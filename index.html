  <h2>1. How the web works</h2>
  <p>The <strong>WEB</strong> is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like <a href ="www.google.com">Google</a>, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>.<br>
    <strong>SERVERS</strong> are computers optimized for hosting data and <strong>HTML</strong> or <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage is the protocol used for communicates between all those elements<br>
    The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <strong>WEB BROWSER</strong>, a local software on everyone's computer, interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.<br>

  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

  <h2>2. What a web page is</h2>
   <p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.<br>
   HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This video</a> gives a good overview.<br>
   HTML documents are made of HTML <b>tags</b>, <b>elements</b> and <b>attributes</b>.<br>
   When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well. An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag "< p >" for example and a closing tag, "< / p >". Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the < br > tag).<br>
  Attributes are the properties of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write "< a href="www.udacity.com" >"
  </p>

  <h2>3. How coding works</h2>

  <p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.<br>
  There are too many details to keep everything in head but search engine are our friends. Coding is a state of mind, knowing how to speak to a computer, with the appropriate language.</p>

  <h2>4. Computers are stupid</h2>
  <p>Computers aren't smart, they interpret litteraly what the programer says to him, small mistakes can lead to huge consequences
